Feature: propfind a shares
  As a user
  I want to check the PROPFIND response
  So that I can make sure that the response contains all the relevant values

  Background:
    Given these users have been created with default attributes:
      | username |
      | Alice    |
      | Brian    |
      | Carol    |

  Scenario Outline: sharee PROPFIND same name shares shared by multiple users
    Given using <dav-path-version> DAV path
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "to share" to "textfile.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "folderToShare"
    And user "Carol" has uploaded file with content "to share" to "textfile.txt"
    And user "Carol" has created folder "folderToShare"
    And user "Alice" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | <resource> |
      | space           | Personal   |
      | sharee          | Brian      |
      | shareType       | user       |
      | permissionsRole | Viewer     |
    And user "Brian" has a share "<resource>" synced
    And user "Carol" has sent the following resource share invitation:
      | resource        | <resource> |
      | space           | Personal   |
      | sharee          | Brian      |
      | shareType       | user       |
      | permissionsRole | Viewer     |
    And user "Brian" has a share "<resource-2>" synced
    When user "Brian" sends PROPFIND request from the space "Shares" to the resource "/" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "207"
    And as user "Brian" the PROPFIND response should contain a space "Shares" with these key and value pairs:
      | key       | value             |
      | oc:fileid | %file_id_pattern% |
      | oc:name   | Shares            |
    And as user "Brian" the PROPFIND response should contain a resource "<resource>" with these key and value pairs:
      | key            | value             |
      | oc:fileid      | %file_id_pattern% |
      | oc:name        | <resource>        |
      | oc:permissions | S                 |
    And as user "Brian" the PROPFIND response should contain a resource "<resource-2>" with these key and value pairs:
      | key            | value             |
      | oc:fileid      | %file_id_pattern% |
      | oc:name        | <resource-2>      |
      | oc:permissions | S                 |
    Examples:
      | dav-path-version | resource      | resource-2        |
      | old              | textfile.txt  | textfile (1).txt  |
      | old              | folderToShare | folderToShare (1) |
      | new              | textfile.txt  | textfile (1).txt  |
      | new              | folderToShare | folderToShare (1) |
